# Applying Lexicon Styles to your App [](id=applying-lexicon-styles-to-your-app)

It's important to have a consistent user experience across your apps. 
@product@'s built-in apps achieve this by utilizing Liferay's 
[Lexicon Experience Language](https://lexicondesign.io/) and it's web 
implementation, [Lexicon](https://liferay.github.io/clay/).

Lexicon is optimized to provide you with a consistent, user-friendly UI for your 
@product@ apps, and is included in all themes that are based on the `_styled` 
base theme. This gives you access to all the components documented on the 
[Lexicon site](https://liferay.github.io/clay/).

This means that you can use Lexicon markup and components in your custom 
@product@ apps. These tutorials explain how to apply Lexicon's design patterns 
to your app, to achieve the same look and feel as @product@'s built-in apps. 

The tutorials in this section cover the following topics:

- Configuring your portlet title and back link
- Applying Lexicon patterns to your forms, navigation, and more
- Using the Add Button pattern
- Implementing the Management Bar
- Configuring your admin app's actions menu
- Setting search container animations
- Using Lexicon icons in your app
