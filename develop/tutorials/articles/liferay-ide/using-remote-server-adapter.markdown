# Using Liferay IDE's Remote Server Adapter

The *Remote Server Adapter* lets developers deploy local projects to a remote
development server for testing purposes--this is its primary use case. Let's 
talk about when to use the Remote Server Adapter, then we'll cover setting it up 
and using it in more detail. 

## When to Use the Remote Server Adapter

Your remote Liferay Portal instance needs to satisfy two requirements to use a
Remote Server Adapter: 

- It is version 6.1 or later. 
- It has the Remote IDE Connector application installed from Liferay
  Marketplace. The Remote IDE Connector contains the `server-manager-web` plugin
  for Liferay that provides an API for Liferay IDE's Remote Server Adapter to
  use for all its remote operations. Alternatively, you can use Liferay IDE's 
  Remote Server wizard to configure the Remote Server Adapter and install the 
  Remote IDE Connector to your remote Liferay instance. This is covered in the 
  next section, *Configuring the Remote Server Adapter*.

If you're using Liferay IDE and want to deploy projects to a remote server, just 
make sure you have access to a remote server with the Remote IDE Connector 
application installed. It's possible to install the Remote IDE Connector 
application on a production server, but it creates an unnecessary security risk, 
so we don't recommend it. Clients shouldn't update, or hot-fix, remotely 
deployed plugins with the adapter; the portal system administrator should use 
normal mechanisms to apply plugin updates and fixes. 

To start deploying projects to a remote server, you'll need to have the 
following resources installed on your local development machine:

- [Liferay IDE](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-projects/liferay-ide) or [Liferay Developer Studio](http://www.liferay.com/group/customer/products/developer-studio/1.6).
- [Liferay Portal CE or EE](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases). 

You'll need to download [Liferay Portal CE or EE](http://www.liferay.com/downloads/liferay-portal/available-releases)
to your remote (test) server as well. 

This demonstration uses the Remote Server Adapter on Liferay Portal bundled with
Apache Tomcat, but you can use the adapter with Liferay Portal running on any
application server Liferay Portal supports. Install Liferay Portal locally to
compile the plugins you develop. Install Liferay Portal on your remote test
server to host the plugins you'll deploy to it.

 ![Important](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Important:** Keep a record of
 your portal administrator login credentials (e.g., username/password) for your
 remote Liferay server; you'll need them to configure your connection from
 Liferay IDE to the remote Liferay server. 

---

Now you're ready to configure the Remote Server Adapter! 

## Configuring the Remote Server Adapter

To configure the Remote Server Adapter, use the following steps: 

1.  Start your remote Liferay Portal instance and verify that you can log in as
    an administrator.

2.  Launch Liferay IDE and open the new server wizard by clicking *File* &rarr;
    *New* &rarr; *Other*; select *Server* in the Server category and click
    *Next*. Select *Remote Liferay Server (Liferay 6.2)* in the Liferay, Inc.
    category.

3.  Enter the IP address of the machine with the remote Liferay Portal instance
    into the *Server's host name* field. For the *Server name*, enter
    *Liferay@\[IP address\]*, then click *Next*. 

    ![Figure 1: Configure the remote Liferay server's information.](../../images/remote_server_adapter_wizard_1.png)

4.  The New Server wizard's next page directs you to define the Liferay
    Portal runtime stub. Doing so allows projects created for your remote server
    to use the runtime stub for satisfying JAR dependencies needed to compile
    various Liferay projects. Select the *Liferay bundle type* based on the
    version of your local Liferay bundle, browse to the *Liferay bundle
    directory*, and click *Next*. 

5.  On the next page of the wizard, configure your connection to your remote
    Liferay instance: 
    - **Hostname:** Enter the IP address of your remote Liferay Portal instance's
    machine. 
    - **HTTP Port:** Enter the port it runs on (default: 8080). 
    - **Username** and **Password:** Enter your administrator credentials for the
    remote Liferay Portal instance. 

    Leave the *Liferay Portal Context Path* and *Server Manager Context Path*
    set to the defaults unless these values were changed for your remote Liferay
    Portal instance.  

6.  Your remote Liferay Portal instance needs the Remote IDE Connector
    application installed; otherwise, Liferay IDE can't connect to it. If you
    haven't installed Liferay IDE Connector yet, click the *Remote IDE Connector*
    link in the wizard. If you already downloaded the Remote IDE Connector
    application and installed it to your remote portal, skip to the next step and
    validate your connection. 

    Browse [Liferay Marketplace](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace) for the
    Remote IDE Connector application. When you've found it, click *Free* to
    purchase it. Follow the on-screen prompts. 

    Once you've purchased the application, navigate to the *Purchased* page of
    the Control Panel's Marketplace interface. 

    ![Figure 2: Click *Purchased* in the Marketplace section of the Control Panel to download and install the Remote IDE Connector application that you purchased.](../../images/remote_server_adapter_marketplace_2.png)

    Find your application in the list of purchased products. Then click on the
    buttons to download and install the application. Once it's been installed on
    your remote portal, return to the Remote Liferay Server configuration wizard
    in Liferay IDE. 

7.  Click the *Validate Connection* button; if no warnings or errors appear.
    your connection works! If you get any warning or error messages in the
    configuration wizard, check your connection settings. 

8.  Once Liferay IDE is connected to your remote Liferay Portal instance,
    click *Finish* in the Remote Liferay Server configuration wizard. 
   
    After you click *Finish*, the new remote server appears in Liferay IDE's
    *Servers* tab. This tab appears in the bottom left corner of the Eclipse
    window if you're using the Liferay perspective. If you entered your
    connection settings correctly, Eclipse connects to your remote server and
    displays the remote Liferay Portal instance's logs in the console. If your
    remote server is in debug mode, the Eclipse Java debugger is attached to the
    remote process automatically.

9.  You can change the remote server settings at any time. Double-click on your
    remote server instance in the *Servers* tab to open the configuration
    editor, where you can modify the settings. 

Now that your remote Liferay Portal server is configured, let's test the remote
server adapter!

## Using the Remote Server Adapter

Once your remote Liferay Portal server is correctly configured and your local
Liferay IDE is connected to it, you can begin publishing projects to it and
using it as you would a local Liferay Portal server. 

Here's how to publish plugin projects to your remote server in Liferay IDE: 

1.  Right click on the server and choose *Add and Remove...*. 

    ---

    ![Note](../../images/tip-pen-paper.png) **Note:** Make sure you have
    available projects configured in Liferay IDE. If not, you'll get an error
    message indicating there are no available resources to add or remove from
    the server. 

    ---

2.  Select the Liferay projects to publish to your remote server; click *Add* to
    add them to your remote server, then click *Finish*. Deployment begins
    immediately. If publication to the remote server was successful, your
    console displays a message that the plugin was successfully deployed!

3.  As you make changes to your plugin project, republish them so they take
    effect on the remote server. To set your remote server's publication
    behavior, double click your remote server in the *Servers* tab. You can
    choose to automatically publish resources after changes are made,
    automatically publish after a build event, or never to publish
    automatically. To manually invoke the publishing operation after having
    modified project files, right click on the server in the Servers view and
    select *Publish*. 

Great! Now that you know how to use Liferay IDE to deploy plugin projects to 
remote servers, you can more easily integrate your remote portal instances into 
your testing workflow. 

## Next Steps    

Next, let's examine the structure of Liferay's Plugins SDK. We'll also learn how
to use it independently of Liferay IDE.
